# MNIST Training with 4 layers linear NN

The MNIST images are (probably) sufficient for training your model. However, do note that too much epoch may cause *overfitting*.
To run the model, upload it to <https://colab.google/> and run it.
Do note that CNN will actually perform better than linear layers (in normal situations).

You can try to tweak and tune some parameters. :D
To execute the streamlit GUI, simply run the following:
```
streamlit run xxx.py
```
However, remember to first link your PyTorch file path and import your model in the Python file first!
