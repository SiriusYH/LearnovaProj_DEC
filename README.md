# MNIST Training with 4 layers linear NN

The MNIST images are (probably) sufficient for training your model. However, do note that too much epoch may cause *overfitting*.
To run the model, upload it to <https://colab.google/> and run it.
Do note that CNN will actually perform better than linear layers (in normal situation).

You can try to tweak and tune some parameters. :D
